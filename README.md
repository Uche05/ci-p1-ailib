## Mock-up Screenshots

Below are two mock-up images of the AI Library website created using the  <a href="https://ui.dev/">"Am I Responsive" website</a>.

## UX

- The design for AI Library was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- AI Library site was designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind.
- A simple clean look was built so that all a user feels comfortable and neutral when using AILib to study.
- AILib or AI Library is meant for people who are need knowledge of AI and it's state of the arts.

### Colour Scheme

- The chosen colour scheme for AI Library is designed to be inviting and have a neutral aesthetic while giving a nice splash of colour aesthetic for color-blinded people.
- The colours used are as follows:-
- #03045e (Federal Blue)
- #0077b6
- #ffffff (white)

- I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/7f0ffb-c27b6f-9ecffa-fafafa-000000) to generate my colour palette initially.
- I used [coloors.contrastchecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker) to check the contrast between text and background colors used, ensuring readability.
- I used [colorblindor](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to ensure my chosen color palette is fit for color-blinded people. This feature was available in Firefox's Developer tools.


### Typography

- I used the Google Font called 'Moderustic' for the AI Library site and 'Lora' for the header.
- I felt that this font had a cool style that is easy to read and that it fitted well with the AI Library site.
- Montserrat was specifically used for the main content text. 

## Icons
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the AI Library site, for GitHub links in the footer and modal and for the search icon in the main weather card.

Please note, I did not cold copy and paste actual written content from wikipedia to my website. I stated all actual word-by-word references on the written content where necessary.

## [Testing](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p1-ailib), navigate to the Settings tab.
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the **Main** Branch, then click "Save".
- The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found [here](https://uche05.github.io/ci-p1-ailib/).

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p1-ailib).
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it.
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
    - `git clone https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p1-ailib.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

For Gitpod users, this was not implemented on gitpod, it was from my local PC directly to Github via git and some useful VSCode extensions.

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p1-ailib).
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Local vs Deployment

There are no notable differences between my local developed site and the GitHub pages deployed site.
