## Accessibility

I have tested my deployed project using the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) web accessibility evaluation tool to check for any accessibility issues.

| Page | Summary | Details | Contrast | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| All Pages | ![screenshot](documentation/features/wave1.png) | 1 Error: Empty Form Label | The label used for the nav bar was considered an error but was meant to be used as nav bar for different  | An empty form label was considered an error but was necessary for the nav bar for smaller devices. |
| Contact Page | ![screenshot](documentation/features/wave2.png) | 4 Contrast errors | The emojis used did not have a good contrast to background | I did not change anything about it as I needed those emojis. So I added styling to the input elements to make it stand out more.|

## User Story Testing

## Bugs

The following are bugs that I have come across while creating the AI Lib Site.

### HTML

- Bad value for attribute id on element img as by the HTML Validator, An ID must not be the empty string.
- To resolve this, I simply removed any empty id attribute to the img element(s).
<hr>

- No alt attribute in an img element.
- This was resolved as it was the image element of the navbar and I simply gave it the alternative name, "menu".
<hr>

- Text inserted directly in the "details" element as by HTML Validator, Text not allowed in element details in this context.
- I simply used the paragraph element, "p" to nest all text used in the details element(s).
<hr>

- Text inserted directly in the "ol" element as by HTML Validator, Text not allowed in element ol in this context. (3)
- I used appropriate list elements to subdue the naked texts.
<hr>

- "br" used as child of "ol" as by HTML Validator, Element br not allowed as child of element ol in this context.
- I removed all br elements in my code.
<hr>

- Certain elements were misplaced as stated by HTML Validator, "No li element in scope but a li end tag seen".
- I located such element and deleted the excesses.
<hr>

- Text inserted directly into summary element, as stated by HTML Validator, "Text not allowed in element ___ in this context."
- To first fix this I made use of the p element to nest the text, however it still resulted in an error,
so I checked the W3C document recommended and used ChatGPT to provide me aid to this problem and I needed to use an inline element to wrap naked text unto
for a summary element.
I ended up using the "em" element but replaced it with the "span" element as the "em" made the 'overall look too much boldening to see'.
<hr>

- Summary element at the wrong position inside the details element. This resulted in two errors thus stating,
"Element details is missing a required instance of child element summary."
,"Element summary not allowed as child of element details in this context."
- To fix this error I placed the summary element before the text rather than after.
<hr>

- Used / instead of / in creating paths for file documents.
- Simply used the forward slash characher(/) to put relative file paths.
<hr>

- When making a button for the contact form, I nested a button element in an "a" element.
- I simply removed the button element and styled the "a" element to look like a button instead.
<hr>

- <strong>NOTE</strong>: I made use of a W3C Validator Extension to make the testing process smoothier and faster. I still used the validation website afterwards!

### CSS

- No CSS Bugs to report.

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
